## Mark Moeller (mdm367), Goktug Saatcioglu (gs725)

This is the public for our CS6820 project. This folder contains our write-up [`notes.tex`](./notes.tex). Our code for the implementation can be found under the [`code/`](./code/) folder and there is a [`README`](./code/README.md) to help you get started on running the program. The data we used to generate the graphs and the figures we added to our write-up can be found under the [`figs/`](./figs/) folder.
